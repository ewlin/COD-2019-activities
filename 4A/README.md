# 4A- JavaScript 2
# Activity 2: Loops, if-statements, and Objects in a function

*Goal:*
Write a function that takes an array of positive integers (whole numbers) as the argument (input), and for each value in the array, either print (in the console) the number as is if it’s greater than 10, or the name of the number in English if it’s 10 and under. You don’t need to return an output value. 

*Assumptions:*
You can make the following assumptions while working on this activity: 
* All inputs will be valid, that is, only arrays of positive integers will be passed as arguments to your function
